1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,760
After two years of pandemic emergency,

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:10,040
could 2022 be the year the world

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:15,720
finally learned to live with COVID-19?

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,080
From Asia to Africa,

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:22,080
countries re-opened for business and visitors

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:29,600
following developments in COVID-19 vaccination and treatment.

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:36,000
On New Year's Day, Portugal's President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa

8
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:41,680
announced the easing of COVID-19 restrictions.

9
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,280
He said his country had "moved

10
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,360
into the endemic" period of the pandemic.

11
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,680
Endemic means a disease

12
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:56,640
has settled in a place for years to come.

13
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:01,080
Britain's Prime Minister at the time, Boris Johnson,

14
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:05,680
took similar action later that month.

15
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,680
Announcing an end to requirements for face coverings,

16
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:16,320
he said, "We will trust the judgment of the British people

17
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,360
and no longer criminalize anyone

18
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,160
who chooses not to wear one."

19
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:28,200
The moves were the start of re-opening borders

20
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,000
to members of the European Union

21
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:35,960
and then to vaccinated travelers from around the world.

22
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,560
Australian officials, however,

23
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,440
denied entry to Novak Djokovic,

24
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:47,320
the world's top tennis player, in January.

25
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,440
The country's health officials ruled that Djokovic

26
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:57,520
failed to meet the country's vaccination requirement.

27
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:03,760
The World Health Organization (WHO) added in January

28
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:08,000
that countries could consider easing COVID rules

29
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:11,360
if they had high vaccination rates

30
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:15,680
and strong healthcare systems.

31
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:21,440
In June, South Africa lifted its COVID restrictions.

32
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,120
Visitors can come and go

33
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,680
without vaccination papers or testing.

34
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,440
Other African countries including Madagascar,

35
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:39,440
Egypt, and Botswana soon followed.

36
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:46,040
Many Asian countries opened back up in 2022 as well.

37
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:52,080
Thailand, Vietnam, India, Japan, South Korea,

38
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:59,760
and Indonesia all eased restrictions and welcomed visitors.

39
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:04,240
In the State of the Union speech to Congress in March,

40
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:08,000
American President Joe Biden said,

41
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:12,720
"Last year COVID-19 kept us apart.

42
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:17,320
This year we are finally together again."

43
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:22,440
He noted that the gathering did not require face coverings.

44
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,360
That was possible, he said in his speech,

45
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,520
because of the progress in vaccine

46
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:34,040
and anti-viral treatment efforts.

47
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,160
As the Omicron version of the virus

48
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,200
was quickly spreading around the world,

49
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:45,200
United States health officials approved the first drug

50
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:51,000
against COVID-19 that could be taken at home.

51
00:03:50,001 --> 00:03:54,920
The drug, Paxlovid, is a pill

52
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,320
made by the U.S. drug company Pfizer.

53
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:03,240
All the earlier approved drugs against COVID

54
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,640
require injection directly

55
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:12,160
into the blood by healthcare professionals.

56
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,120
Pfizer made Paxlovid available

57
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:20,760
at low prices to the poorest countries.

58
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:25,760
Dr. Gregory Poland of the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota

59
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,160
spoke about Paxlovid at the time.

60
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,640
He said: "You're looking at a 90 percent decreased risk

61
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:41,000
of hospitalization and death in a high-risk group..."

62
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:44,640
The high-risk group includes older people

63
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:47,280
and those with conditions like

64
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:52,600
being severely overweight or having heart disease.

65
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,600
In August, U.S. health officials approved new vaccines

66
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:02,360
made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.

67
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,160
The new shots are called "bivalent."

68
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:11,120
They are designed to protect against both the earliest

69
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:19,200
and newer versions of Omicron called BA.4 and BA.5.

70
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,480
The approval of the updated vaccines

71
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:28,840
is the first step toward dealing with COVID-19 vaccine updates

72
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:34,120
in the same way as yearly flu shots.

73
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,760
In this case, health officials ordered vaccine makers

74
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:45,080
to make changes and to target the latest coronavirus versions

75
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,880
without depending on human testing.

76
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,000
The U.S. was not the only country

77
00:05:52,001 --> 00:05:57,640
with plans to update COVID-19 vaccines.

78
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:02,280
Health officials in Britain and other European countries

79
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,120
also offered "bivalent" shots

80
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:10,040
to target different versions of the virus.

81
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,520
I'm Caty Weaver.

82
00:06:11,520 --> 
And I'm Mario Ritter Jr.
